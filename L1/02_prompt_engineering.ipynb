    "### How they work together\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with a **good prompt**: clear task, constraints, and an **output contract** (e.g., JSON schema).\n",
    "* Then **ground it with context**: supply only the *most relevant* passages, tables, and tool results.\n",
    "* The prompt guides *behavior*; the context supplies *knowledge*. You usually need both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concrete examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invoice → JSON extractor**\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Prompt engineering*: “Extract fields {vendor, date, total}. Return JSON only. If a field is missing, use null.”\n",
    "* *Context engineering*: Provide a few labeled examples and attach the vendor’s invoice spec retrieved via embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Policy Q\\&A bot**\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Prompt engineering*: “Answer using the attached passages; if unsure, say ‘Not in policy.’ Cite section IDs.”\n",
    "* *Context engineering*: RAG over your policy repo (chunking, metadata filters like `department=HR`, freshness boosts), plus a recency cache for updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agentic workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Prompt engineering*: Tool-use instructions and function signatures.\n",
    "* *Context engineering*: Feed tool responses (DB rows, API payloads) back into the context window each step; maintain short-term memory/state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep prompts **short, specific, and testable**; define output schemas.\n",
    "* Prefer **few-shot** examples only when they generalize; otherwise move them into **retrieval**.\n",
    "* For context: optimize **chunking**, **ranking**, **deduping**, and **token budgets**; log what was retrieved for each answer.\n",
    "* Add **citations** and “answer only from context” instructions when correctness matters.\n",
    "* Evaluate both layers separately: prompt A/B tests and retrieval quality (precision/recall, groundedness).\n",
    "\n",
    "**One-liner:** Prompt engineering is *how you ask*; context engineering is *what you show*. Combine them for reliable, scalable LLM apps."

    "## Understanding Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### How LLMs Work (The Basics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models are prediction engines that:\n",
    "- Take text input (your prompt)\n",
    "- Predict the next most likely word/token\n",
    "- Continue this process to generate complete responses\n",
    "- Base predictions on patterns learned from training data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concept: Autocompletion\n",
    "LLMs don't \"understand\" in the human sense—they're sophisticated autocomplete systems. Your prompt sets up the context for what should come next.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essential Configuration Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into prompt techniques, understand these key parameters that control AI behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature (0-1)\n",
    "- **Low (0-0.3)**: Focused, consistent, deterministic responses\n",
    "- **Medium (0.4-0.7)**: Balanced creativity and consistency\n",
    "- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Creative, diverse, but potentially unpredictable\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- Temperature 0: Math problems, factual questions\n",
    "- Temperature 0.7: Creative writing, brainstorming\n",
    "- Temperature 0.9: Poetry, experimental content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Length/Token Limits\n",
    "- Controls maximum response length\n",
    "- Higher limits = more computational cost\n",
    "- Set appropriately for your task needs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top-K and Top-P (Nucleus Sampling)\n",
    "- **Top-K**: Limits choices to top K most likely tokens\n",
    "- **Top-P**: Limits choices based on cumulative probability\n",
    "- Work together with temperature to control randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended starting points:**\n",
    "- Conservative: Temperature 0.1, Top-P 0.9, Top-K 20\n",
    "- Balanced: Temperature 0.2, Top-P 0.95, Top-K 30\n",

    "## Fundamental Prompting Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest approach—just ask directly without examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Classify this movie review as positive, negative, or neutral:\n",
    "\"The film was visually stunning but the plot felt rushed.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- Simple, well-defined tasks\n",
    "- When the model has clear knowledge of the domain\n",
    "- Quick one-off requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. One-Shot Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a single example to guide the response format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Translate English to French:\n",
    "\n",
    "English: \"Hello, how are you?\"\n",
    "French: \"Bonjour, comment allez-vous?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "English: \"Where is the library?\"\n",
    "French:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Few-Shot Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide multiple examples to establish a clear pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Convert customer feedback to structured data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: \"Great service, but food was cold\"\n",
    "JSON: {\"service\": \"positive\", \"food\": \"negative\", \"overall\": \"mixed\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: \"Amazing experience, will definitely return\"\n",
    "JSON: {\"service\": \"positive\", \"food\": \"positive\", \"overall\": \"positive\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: \"Terrible food and rude staff\"\n",
    "JSON:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practices:**\n",
    "- Use 3-5 examples for most tasks\n",
    "- Include diverse examples\n",
    "- Mix up the classes in classification tasks\n",
    "- Ensure examples are high-quality and consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. System Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Set overall context and behavior guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are a helpful travel guide. Provide practical, accurate information about destinations. Always include:\n",
    "- Key attractions\n",
    "- Local customs to be aware of\n",
    "- Budget considerations\n",
    "- Best time to visit\n",
    "\n",
    "User: Tell me about visiting Tokyo.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Role Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign a specific character or expertise to the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Act as an experienced software architect. I need help designing a scalable web application for 1 million users. What architecture patterns should I consider?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effective roles:**\n",
    "- Subject matter expert (doctor, lawyer, teacher)\n",
    "- Creative roles (writer, designer, poet)\n",
    "- Analytical roles (data analyst, consultant)\n",
    "- Communication styles (friendly tutor, formal advisor)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Contextual Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide specific background information relevant to the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Context: You're writing for a tech blog aimed at beginners who have never coded before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a 200-word explanation of what an API is, using simple language and practical examples.\n",

    "## Advanced Prompting Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Encourage step-by-step reasoning for complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Solve this step by step:\n",
    "If I was 6 when my sister was half my age, how old is my sister when I'm 40?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me think through this step by step:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- Math problems\n",
    "- Logical reasoning\n",
    "- Complex analysis\n",
    "- Multi-step processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practices:**\n",
    "- Use \"Let's think step by step\" or similar phrases\n",
    "- Set temperature to 0 for consistent reasoning\n",
    "- Extract final answers separately from reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "1. Ask the same question multiple times with different phrasings\n",
    "2. Compare the answers\n",
    "3. Choose the most frequently occurring result\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Question: If a store offers a 20% discount on a $50 item, what is the final price?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate 3 different reasoning paths for this question and select the most consistent answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Path 1: To find the final price, calculate the discount: 20% of $50 is 0.20 × 50 = $10. Subtract this from the original price: $50 - $10 = $40. The final price is $40.\n",
    "\n",
    "Path 2: A 20% discount means paying 80% of the original price. So, 80% of $50 is 0.80 × 50 = $40. Therefore, the final price is $40.\n",
    "\n",
    "Path 3: Compute the discount amount: 20% = 0.20, so 0.20 × $50 = $10 off. The original price is $50, so after the discount, it’s $50 - $10 = $40. The final price is $40.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most common answer: $40\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Concept:**\n",
    "Self-Consistency involves generating multiple answers to the same question using varied reasoning approaches to ensure reliability. By comparing the results, you select the most frequent or consistent outcome, reducing the chance of errors from a single flawed reasoning path. This method leverages the model's ability to approach the problem from different angles, increasing confidence in the final answer when all paths converge, as seen here with the consistent result of $40.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-Back Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask a more general question first, then use that context for the specific question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "First, what are the key principles of good user interface design?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Get response]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, using those principles, redesign this mobile app's login screen: [description]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "Question: How should I optimize the loading speed of my e-commerce website?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Step 1: First, what are the key factors that generally affect website loading speed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response: Key factors include:\n",
    "- Server response time (hosting quality, server location)\n",
    "- Image and asset optimization (file size, compression)\n",
    "- Code efficiency (minifying CSS/JavaScript, reducing HTTP requests)\n",
    "- Caching strategies (browser caching, CDNs)\n",
    "- Third-party scripts (ads, analytics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Using these factors, provide specific recommendations to optimize the loading speed of an e-commerce website with heavy product images and multiple third-party plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Response:\n",
    "1. **Server Optimization**: Choose a reliable hosting provider with servers close to your audience. Enable server-side caching (e.g., Redis or Varnish).\n",
    "2. **Image Optimization**: Compress product images using formats like WebP. Implement lazy loading to defer off-screen images.\n",
    "3. **Code Efficiency**: Minify CSS and JavaScript files. Combine small files to reduce HTTP requests.\n",
    "4. **Caching**: Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare to cache static content globally. Set browser cache headers for repeat visitors.\n",
    "5. **Third-Party Plugins**: Audit and remove unnecessary plugins. Asynchronously load scripts for analytics or ads to avoid blocking page rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Concept:**\n",
    "Step-Back Prompting involves first asking a broader, foundational question to establish key principles or context before tackling the specific task. This approach ensures the model grounds its response in general knowledge (e.g., factors affecting website speed) before applying it to the specific problem (e-commerce site optimization). By breaking the task into two steps, the model produces more informed and structured recommendations, reducing the risk of overlooking critical factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine reasoning with tool use or actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I need to find out how many children the members of Metallica have in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought: I need to find information about each band member and their children.\n",
    "Action: Search for \"Metallica band members\"\n",
    "Observation: [results]\n",
    "Thought: Now I need to search for each member individually...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Question: What is the current population of Tokyo, and how does it compare to New York City?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought: I need to find the current population of Tokyo and New York City to compare them. I should start by searching for the latest population data for Tokyo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Action: web_search\n",
    "<parameter name=\"query\">current population of Tokyo 2025</parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation: [Assume tool response: According to recent estimates, Tokyo's population in 2025 is approximately 37.4 million in the metropolitan area.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought: Now I have Tokyo's population. Next, I need the population for New York City.\n",
    "\n",
    "Action: web_search\n",
    "<parameter name=\"query\">current population of New York City 2025</parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation: [Assume tool response: New York City's metropolitan area population in 2025 is estimated at about 23.6 million.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought: With both figures, I can compare them. Tokyo has a larger population than New York City by about 13.8 million people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Answer: Tokyo's population is approximately 37.4 million, compared to New York City's 23.6 million, making Tokyo significantly larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Concept:**\n",
    "ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) is a prompting strategy that interleaves reasoning steps (Thoughts) with actions (tool calls or external queries) to solve complex problems iteratively. Each cycle includes a Thought (planning the next step), an Action (executing a tool or search), and an Observation (processing the result). This loop continues until the question is resolved, allowing the model to dynamically gather information and refine its approach. It's particularly useful for tasks requiring real-time data or multi-step verification, as demonstrated by sequentially fetching and comparing population data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore multiple reasoning branches simultaneously for complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- Creative problem solving\n",
    "- Strategic planning\n",
    "- Complex decision-making\n",
    "- Tasks requiring exploration of alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What is the best marketing strategy for launching a new eco-friendly clothing brand targeting young adults?\n",

    "Task: Explore multiple strategic approaches, evaluate them, and select the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch 1: Social Media Campaign**\n",
    "Thought: Young adults are active on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. A campaign using influencers could build brand awareness.\n",
    "Exploration:\n",
    "- Pros: High engagement, visually appealing for clothing, cost-effective with micro-influencers.\n",
    "- Cons: Risk of inauthentic partnerships, oversaturation in influencer marketing.\n",
    "Evaluation: Strong for visibility but needs unique content to stand out. Score: 8/10.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch 2: Sustainable Pop-Up Events**\n",
    "Thought: Hosting pop-up shops at eco-conscious festivals or college campuses could create direct engagement.\n",
    "Exploration:\n",
    "- Pros: Hands-on experience with products, builds community, aligns with eco-friendly values.\n",
    "- Cons: High logistical costs, limited geographic reach.\n",
    "Evaluation: Great for brand authenticity but resource-intensive. Score: 7/10.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch 3: Collaborative Partnerships**\n",
    "Thought: Partnering with eco-friendly brands (e.g., sustainable accessories) could cross-promote to aligned audiences.\n",
    "Exploration:\n",
    "- Pros: Expands reach via partner networks, reinforces eco-mission.\n",
    "- Cons: Complex coordination, potential brand dilution.\n",
    "Evaluation: Effective for niche targeting but requires careful partner selection. Score: 7.5/10.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synthesis**: Combine a social media campaign (Branch 1) with selective pop-up events (Branch 2) for maximum impact. Use partnerships (Branch 3) to amplify reach at events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Strategy: Launch with a TikTok influencer campaign showcasing eco-friendly clothing, paired with pop-up shops at green festivals to engage young adults directly. Collaborate with a sustainable accessory brand to co-promote at events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Concept:**\n",
    "Tree of Thoughts (ToT) involves generating multiple reasoning branches to explore different solutions to a problem, evaluating each, and synthesizing the best ideas into a final answer.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of MoE:\n",
    "1. **Experts**: These are specialized sub-networks (often feed-forward neural networks) within the model, each trained to handle specific types of data or tasks. For example, one expert might specialize in mathematical reasoning, another in creative writing, and so on. In advanced LLMs, there can be dozens or hundreds of experts (e.g., Mixtral 8x7B has 8 experts per layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gating Network (or Router)**: This is a lightweight mechanism (typically a simple neural network) that evaluates the input and decides which experts to route the data to. It assigns weights or probabilities to experts, selecting the top-k (e.g., top 2 out of 8) most relevant ones. The output is a weighted combination of the selected experts' responses. The gating is learned during training and can be dynamic, adapting to the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sparse Activation**: Unlike dense models (e.g., GPT-3 or Llama) where all parameters are activated for every token, MoE activates only a fraction (e.g., 10-20%) of the parameters per input. This makes MoE models \"conditionally compute\" – they scale to trillions of parameters but run as efficiently as smaller dense models during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How MoE Works in LLMs:\n",
    "- **Training**: During pre-training, the model learns to route inputs to appropriate experts via auxiliary losses (e.g., load balancing to prevent any single expert from being overused). This is often done on massive datasets to ensure experts specialize without overlapping too much.\n",
    "- **Inference**: For a prompt, the gating network processes the input tokens layer by layer, routing them to experts. This parallelism allows for faster training and inference on hardware like GPUs/TPUs, as unused experts can be skipped.\n",
    "- **Benefits**:\n",
    "  - **Efficiency**: Models like Grok-1 (314B parameters but activates ~25% per token) or Mixtral achieve high performance with lower compute costs compared to dense models of similar effective size.\n",
    "  - **Scalability**: Enables \"expert scaling\" where adding more experts increases capacity without proportional compute growth.\n",
    "  - **Specialization**: Experts can capture diverse knowledge, potentially leading to better handling of niche tasks.\n",
    "- **Drawbacks**:\n",
    "  - **Routing Instability**: The gating can sometimes fail to balance load, leading to inefficiencies or biases.\n",
    "  - **Memory Overhead**: Storing many experts requires more memory, though sparsity mitigates runtime costs.\n",
    "  - **Interpretability Challenges**: It's harder to understand why a specific expert was chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "MoE has become prevalent in advanced LLMs since around 2023, with models like Mistral's Mixtral, Google's Switch Transformers, and xAI's Grok-1 adopting it. **By 2025, most frontier models (e.g., those from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and xAI) incorporate MoE variants for better parameter efficiency in the race toward AGI-scale systems.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does MoE Change Prompt Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering – the art of crafting inputs to elicit optimal responses from LLMs – traditionally focuses on clarity, structure, role-playing, chain-of-thought (CoT), and few-shot examples to guide dense models. MoE introduces nuances because of its modular, expert-based design, shifting the focus toward \"expert elicitation\" and robustness to routing dynamics. While core principles remain, MoE can make prompts more effective (or unpredictable) depending on how they activate the underlying experts. Here's how it impacts the practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Need for Expert-Aware Prompting**:\n",
    "   - In MoE models, the gating mechanism interprets the input to select experts. Vague or overly broad prompts might route to generic experts, leading to mediocre outputs, while targeted prompts can \"awaken\" specialized ones.\n",
    "   - **Change**: Engineers must design prompts to signal specific domains. For instance, starting with \"As a math expert...\" might route to numerical specialists, improving accuracy on equations. This is akin to \"role-playing\" but more potent due to built-in specialization.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In a dense model, a simple \"Solve 2x + 3 = 7\" works fine. In MoE, prefixing with \"Using algebraic expertise:\" could ensure routing to a math-focused expert, reducing errors from misrouting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Enhanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Multi-Step Reasoning**:\n",
    "   - MoE's experts can handle sub-tasks modularly, so prompts that break down problems (e.g., \"Step 1: Analyze facts with historical expert. Step 2: Predict with forecasting expert.\") leverage routing for better decomposition.\n",
    "   - **Change**: Prompts become more \"orchestrated,\" explicitly invoking expert-like steps. This can amplify CoT effectiveness, as different experts process intermediate steps. Studies show MoE models excel in long-context reasoning when prompts guide routing progressively.\n",
    "   - **Tip**: Use iterative prompting (e.g., via API calls) to refine outputs, as initial routing might not be perfect – re-prompt with feedback to re-route.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Handling Sparsity and Variability**:\n",
    "   - Outputs can vary more across runs due to stochastic routing (if top-k selection has randomness), making deterministic prompting harder.\n",
    "   - **Change**: Emphasize consistency techniques like temperature=0 (for greedy decoding) or repeated sampling to average expert activations. Also, test prompts across multiple runs to identify routing-sensitive ones. In production, this might require \"prompt ensembles\" where multiple variants are tried to hit the right experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Efficiency in Prompt Length and Complexity**:\n",
    "   - Shorter, focused prompts can efficiently activate few experts, reducing latency – a boon for real-time apps.\n",
    "   - **Change**: MoE encourages concise, intent-clear prompts over verbose ones. However, for creative or open-ended tasks, adding domain hints (e.g., \"In the style of a sci-fi expert\") can unlock diverse expert combinations without bloating the input.\n",
    "   - **Few-Shot Learning**: Examples in prompts help \"train\" the router on-the-fly, making MoE more adaptable to custom tasks than dense models, but they must align with expert domains to avoid dilution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Broader Implications and Best Practices**:\n",
    "   - **Positive Shifts**: MoE reduces the need for heavy fine-tuning; prompt engineering can \"fine-tune\" via routing. It's great for multilingual or multimodal LLMs, where prompts specify modalities to route correctly.\n",
    "   - **Challenges**: Black-box routing means trial-and-error is key – use A/B testing or logging to analyze which prompts activate desired behaviors. Ethically, be aware of potential biases if experts specialize unevenly (e.g., cultural experts).\n",
    "   - **Evolving Landscape (as of 2025)**: With models like advanced Grok versions or Llama 3 MoE variants, tools like prompt optimizers (e.g., DSPy or Guidance) are adapting to simulate routing. Research suggests MoE amplifies prompt sensitivity, so hybrid approaches (combining with RAG for external knowledge) are rising.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Small wording changes can steer which experts wake up\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a router chooses experts *based on your tokens*, small wording changes can steer which experts wake up. That means prompt craft can influence which specialization you tap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do more of this\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Front-load domain signals.** Put the clearest task + domain cues in the first few lines to help the router lock onto the right experts early.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * “Role: Financial analyst. Task: 10-K variance analysis. Output: tabular summary + bullet risks.”\n",
    "2. **Use unambiguous, domain-specific vocabulary.** The router keys off tokens; plain, on-topic terms beat clever phrasing or euphemisms.\n",
    "3. **Separate mixed tasks.** If you combine coding, legal, and marketing in one shot, the router may oscillate experts. Break it into steps or run sequential prompts.\n",
    "4. **Match examples to the task.** Few-shot exemplars should be in the *same domain, format, and language* as your goal—this strongly reinforces the intended experts.\n",
    "5. **Be explicit about language and style.** Start with: “Language: Urdu. Style: concise, technical.” Multilingual MoE models often have language-specialized experts.\n",
    "6. **Stabilize when you need consistency.** Lower temperature/top-p reduces token drift, which indirectly reduces expert churn across the generation.\n",
    "7. **Keep retrieval context clean.** In RAG, put a short task summary *before* the docs, and keep the docs on-topic; noisy context can misroute tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do less of this\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cute indirection (“you know what I mean”)**—it weakens routing signals.\n",
    "* **Overlong preambles** that bury the true task. MoE routes per token, but early tokens set the scene.\n",
    "* **Mashing multiple formats** (e.g., code + poetry + SQL) in one go—split it.\n",

    "## Troubleshooting with MoE models\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inconsistent answers across runs?** Add sharper domain anchors at the top; reduce temperature; include one very short, in-domain example.\n",
    "* **It “misses” the skill you want (e.g., math vs. writing)?** Use explicit skill tags (“Task type: quantitative proof/derivation”) and show the target format in a tiny exemplar.\n",
    "* **Mixed-topic responses?** Split the request; or ask for a plan first, then execute each step in a follow-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom line:** MoE doesn’t change the *foundation* of prompt engineering, but it **raises the leverage of clear, early, domain-specific signals** because they literally decide which specialists inside the model wake up for your tokens.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is both an art and a science. It requires understanding how AI models work, clear communication skills, and systematic experimentation. The key to success is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start simple** and add complexity gradually\n",
    "2. **Be specific** about what you want\n",
    "3. **Provide examples** whenever possible\n",
    "4. **Test and iterate** to improve results\n",
    "5. **Document your successes** for future reference\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI models continue to evolve, prompt engineering techniques will also advance. Stay curious, keep experimenting, and remember that the best prompt is one that consistently gives you the results you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The future of AI interaction lies in clear, effective communication—and prompt engineering is your toolkit for making that communication as powerful as possible.\n",
